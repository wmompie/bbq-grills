        <p>Gas-fueled grills typically use propane or natural gas as their fuel source, with gas-flame either cooking food directly or heating grilling elements which in turn radiate the heat necessary to cook food. Our gas grills are available in sizes ranging from small, single steak grills up to large, industrial sized restaurant grills which are able to cook enough meat to fee a hundred or more people. Our gas grills are designed for either LP or NG, although it's possible to convert some of our grills from one gas source to another &#40;specialty made item&#41;.</p>
        <p>The majority of our gas grills follow the cart grill design concept: the grill unit itself is attached to a wheeled frame that holds the fuel tank. The wheeled frame may also support side tables and other features depending on the model you choose.</p>

            <p>A recent trend in gas grills is for us to add an infrared radiant burner to the back of the grill enclosure. This radiant burner provides an even heat across the burner and is intended for use with a horizontal rotisserie. A meat item &#40;whole chicken, beef roast, pork loin roast&#41; is placed on a metal skewer that is rotated by an electric motor. Smaller cuts of meat can be grilled in this manner using a round metal basket that slips over the metal skewer.</p>

            <p>Another type of gas grill we offer that is gaining popularity is called a flattop grill. Flattop grills on which food cooks on a griddle&#45;like surface and is not exposed to an open flame at all is an emerging trand in the outdoor grilling market.</p>

            <img id="smoker" src="img/smoker.jpg" alt="Gas Powered Smoker Grill">
            <p>A small metal &#39;smoker box&#39; containing wood chips may be used on one of our gas grills to give a smoky flavor to grilled foods. Although, barbeque purists would argue that to get a true smoky flavor &#40;and smoke ring&#41; the user has to cook low and slow, indirectly and using wood or charcoal. Our gas grills are difficult to maintain at the low temperatures required, especially for extended periods so please keep this in mind when choosing a grill.</p>
