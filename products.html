            <p>We offer Shish Kebab Sticks made from real bamboo for those that prefer to enjoy the taste of their food the natural way.

This pack does come in many sizes ranging in 20 pack, 50 pack and our most popular 100 pack. Note the larger the size, the more you save.</p>

            <h3>Recent trends in Gas Grills</h3>

            <img id="korean" src="img/korean_barbecue.jpg" alt="Korean BBQ using infrared radiant burner">
            <p>A recent trend in gas grills is for us to add an infrared radiant burner to the back of the grill enclosure. This radiant burner provides an even heat across the burner and is intended for use with a horizontal rotisserie. A meat item &#40;whole chicken, beef roast, pork loin roast&#41; is placed on a metal skewer that is rotated by an electric motor. Smaller cuts of meat can be grilled in this manner using a round metal basket that slips over the metal skewer.</p>

            <img id="flattop" src="img/flattop.jpg" alt="French Flattop Grill">
            <p>Another type of gas grill we offer that is gaining popularity is called a flattop grill. Flattop grills on which food cooks on a griddle&#45;like surface and is not exposed to an open flame at all is an emerging trand in the outdoor grilling market.</p>

        <article id="article">
            <img id="smoker" src="img/smoker.jpg" alt="Gas Powered Smoker Grill">
            <p>A small metal &#39;smoker box&#39; containing wood chips may be used on one of our gas grills to give a smoky flavor to grilled foods. Although, barbeque purists would argue that to get a true smoky flavor &#40;and smoke ring&#41; the user has to cook low and slow, indirectly and using wood or charcoal. Our gas grills are difficult to maintain at the low temperatures required, especially for extended periods so please keep this in mind when choosing a grill.</p>
